## 🧠 Setting Up Dialogflow & Importing Intents

### Step 1: Create a Dialogflow Account
1. Visit [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Agree to terms and create a Google Cloud project if prompted.

### Step 2: Create a New Agent
1. In the Dialogflow Console, click the **gear icon ⚙️** (next to your agent name).
2. If you don’t have an agent yet:
   - Click **Create new agent**.
   - Enter your **Agent Name**, **Default Language**, and **Default Time Zone**.
   - Choose your **Google Cloud Project** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Enable Dialogflow API & Download Credentials
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (created during the agent setup).
3. In the left menu, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
4. Search for **Dialogflow API**, and **Enable** it.
5. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
6. Click **Create Credentials > Service Account Key**:
   - Choose **Service Account**
   - Select **JSON** as the key type
7. Click **Create**, and a `.json` file will be downloaded.  
   _Save it in your project root directory and update the path in your code accordingly._

### Step 4: Set Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended)

Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your key:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path_to_your_file.json"
```

### Step 5: Import and Train Intents with Python Script

If you have a file like `intents.json`, the app already includes a function:

```python
import_intents_from_json('vast-ytfa-36b7391b4430.json')
```

To run it, simply do this in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

It will:
- Read your intent patterns and responses
- Create intents in Dialogflow automatically
- Print `Intents imported successfully!` once done

📅 Make sure your JSON follows this structure:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "See you", "Goodbye"],
      "responses": ["See you later!", "Bye!", "Take care!"]
    }
  ]
}
```
