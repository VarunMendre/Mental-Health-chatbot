🧠 Setting Up Dialogflow & Importing Intents
Step 1: Create a Dialogflow Account
Visit Dialogflow Console

Sign in with your Google account.

Agree to terms and create a Google Cloud project if prompted.

Step 2: Create a New Agent
In the Dialogflow Console, click the gear icon ⚙️ (next to your agent name).

If you don’t have an agent yet:

Click Create new agent.

Enter your Agent Name, Default Language, and Default Time Zone.

Choose your Google Cloud Project (or create a new one).

Click Create.

Step 3: Enable Dialogflow API & Download Credentials
Go to Google Cloud Console

Select your project (created during the agent setup).

In the left menu, go to APIs & Services > Library.

Search for Dialogflow API, and Enable it.

Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Click Create Credentials > Service Account Key:

Choose Service Account

Select JSON as the key type

Click Create, and a .json file will be downloaded.
Save it in your project root directory and update the path in your code accordingly.

Step 4: Set Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended)
Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to your key:

bash
Copy
Edit
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path_to_your_file.json"
Step 5: Import and Train Intents with Python Script
If you have a file like intents.json, the app already includes a function:

python
Copy
Edit
import_intents_from_json('vast-ytfa-36b7391b4430.json')
To run it, simply do this in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
It will:

Read your intent patterns and responses

Create intents in Dialogflow automatically

Print Intents imported successfully! once done

✅ Make sure your JSON follows this structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "See you", "Goodbye"],
      "responses": ["See you later!", "Bye!", "Take care!"]
    }
  ]
}
