### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Your Environment
1. Store the credentials path in an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./your_service_account_file.json"
```

2. Alternatively, hardcode the path (not recommended for production):
```python
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "your_service_account_file.json"
```

### üìÜ Step 4: Train Intents Using a JSON File
Ensure your `intents.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greet",
      "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi there"],
      "responses": ["Hi! How can I help you today?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "thanks",
      "patterns": ["Thanks", "Thank you"],
      "responses": ["You're welcome!", "No problem!"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the helper function in `app.py` to import:

```python
import_intents_from_json("intents.json")
```

Run the script:
```bash
python app.py
```

This will import all your training phrases and responses to Dialogflow.

### üöÄ You're All Set!

Now your chatbot is ready to receive and handle user queries using the trained intents.
